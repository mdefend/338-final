        <p>Hi! I'm Maggie and I made this website to show off my digital camera photos! Over the summer I got gifted 2 old cameras from my aunt and I've had a lot of fun using them. Feel free to check out some of the photos I've taken in the gallery or try a camera yourself with the camera simulator!</p>

     <h3>Canon PowerShot SD780</h3>
     <div class="pain1">
      <p>This is my easier to use and more portable camera. It's quite beaten up though and barely works 50% of the time. However, it does produce really nice photos and is fun to take places. </p>

    <h3>Canon PowerShot SX130</h3>
        <div class="pain1">
        <p>This camera is lot larger and less portable. It does work a lot more smoothly though, so a majority of my photos are taken with it. The only major issue with it is that it decides all photos are from 1980 regardless of the date.</p>
